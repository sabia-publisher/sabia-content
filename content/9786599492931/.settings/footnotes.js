However, it is known that pursuing such deeds are complex systemic challenges that many times are not taken forward. On this subject, it is worth mentioning the case of Brazil, whose government was one of the countries who signed the Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Us on the 12th of November of 2021, committing to reduce drastically deforestation in the country and contain 30% of methane emissions by 2030 (information retrieved from https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/, accessed on 18.12.2021) . However,  Brazilian leadership has not put forward relevant measures that support this objective. As Brazilian’s Government representatives announce the program “Floresta+”, official data from Deter (the country’s platform for measuring the Amazon Forest’s coverage) shows that, over the last two years under their watch, deforestation on the Amazon has grown immensely compared to previous years."
